# ⚡ Accio CLI

**Accio** is a blazing-fast, modern, and user-friendly command-line tool built in **Rust**.  
It provides functionality similar to Unix file utilities such as listing, locating, and managing files using **multi-threading**, **progress indicators**, and **tiny footprint performance**.

---

## ✨ Features

- Lightweight and compiled with Rust’s zero-cost abstractions  
- Sub-command architecture using [`clap`](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap)  
- Dynamic progress spinners with [`indicatif`](https://github.com/console-rs/indicatif)  
- Optional multi-core parallel search using [`rayon`](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon)  
- Clean professional CLI with automatic help and version flags  
- Reports execution time (e.g., `2m 32secs` format)

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Install **Rust** (via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs))
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/accio.git
   cd accio

3. Build:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
4. Run:

   ```bash
   cargo run -- <COMMAND>
   ```

---

## 📖 Usage

### 1. Show Help

```bash
accio --help
```

### 2. Print Working Directory

```bash
accio pwd
```

### 3. List Files in Current Directory

```bash
accio ls
```

### 4. Search for a File

```bash
accio search <filename>
```

**Example:**

```bash
accio search report.txt
```

When executed, you will be prompted for:

```text
Enter directory path to scan: D:\Projects
Use parallel search (Rayon)? (y/n): y
Starting parallel search...
✔ Found the following files: (Completed in 1m 34secs)
D:\Projects\Docs\report.txt
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

* `clap` provides declarative argument parsing and help.
* `indicatif` displays real-time scanning progress.
* `rayon` provides optional parallel recursive scanning using all CPU cores.
* Both sequential and parallel modes measure execution time using Rust’s built-in timers.

| `ls`                | Lists all files and folders in the current directory                 |
| `search <filename>` | Recursively searches for the specified filename in a given directory |
| `-h`, `--help`      | Displays help information                                            |
| `--version`         | Displays the version number                                          |
